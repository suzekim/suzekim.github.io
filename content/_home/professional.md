I am a product owner and software engineer based in Lexington, MA. 
Recently, I completed a Masters in Computer Information SYstems (MSCIS) at Boston University. 
Previously, I worked as a software engineer at Kessel Run. 

I subscribe to the clich√© notion of do what you love, love what you do.
These days, I enjoy learning and practice product design as well as photography!
This site isn't really a blog so much as it is an experiment.
